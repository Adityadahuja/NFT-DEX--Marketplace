## 📝 Project Description

The <b>Simple Token Transfer Contract</b> is a Clarity smart contract that implements a basic fungible token (FT) on the Stacks blockchain. It enables users to securely transfer tokens, check balances, and serves as a robust foundation for building more advanced decentralized applications (dApps) and token economies.

## 🌟 Project Vision

To empower developers and users with a transparent, easy-to-use, and secure token contract that can be integrated into a wide range of blockchain projects, from DeFi to gaming and beyond. This project aims to be a reference implementation and a launchpad for innovation on Stacks.
