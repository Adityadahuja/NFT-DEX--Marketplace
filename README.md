# NFT-DEX Marketplace

## Project Title
**NFT-DEX Marketplace** - A Specialized Decentralized Exchange for Non-Fungible Tokens

## Project Description

The NFT-DEX Marketplace is an innovative decentralized exchange built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. This specialized platform revolutionizes NFT trading by introducing advanced features such as:

- **Fractional Ownership**: Break down expensive NFTs into smaller, tradeable shares, making high-value digital assets accessible to a broader range of investors
- **Liquidity Pools**: Integrate liquidity pool mechanisms for better price discovery and reduced slippage in NFT transactions
- **Escrow System**: Secure smart contract-based escrow that holds NFTs during the listing period, ensuring trust and security
- **Multi-Collection Support**: Compatible with various NFT collections through trait-based architecture
- **Fee Distribution**: Platform sustainability through configurable fee structures that support liquidity provision

The marketplace addresses key challenges in the current NFT ecosystem:
- **Liquidity Issues**: Traditional NFT markets suffer from low liquidity and high price volatility
- **Accessibility Barriers**: High-value NFTs are inaccessible to smaller investors
- **Price Discovery**: Limited mechanisms for efficient price discovery in illiquid markets
- **Security Concerns**: Centralized platforms pose custody and counterparty risks

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create the most liquid, accessible, and secure NFT trading environment on the Stacks ecosystem. We aim to:

1. **Democratize NFT Ownership**: Enable fractional ownership to make premium NFTs accessible to everyone, regardless of capital size

2. **Enhance Market Efficiency**: Implement liquidity pool mechanisms that provide continuous liquidity and fair price discovery for NFT assets

3. **Build Trust Through Transparency**: Utilize blockchain technology and smart contracts to create a transparent, trustless trading environment where users maintain full control of their assets

4. **Foster Innovation**: Serve as a foundation for advanced DeFi-NFT hybrid products, including NFT-collateralized lending, yield farming with NFT rewards, and cross-chain NFT trading

5. **Create Sustainable Economics**: Develop a self-sustaining ecosystem where platform fees support liquidity providers and drive continuous platform improvement

- STX tokens for transaction fees
- Compatible NFT collection for testing

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nft-dex-marketplace.git
   cd nft-dex-marketplace
   ```

2. **Initialize Clarinet project** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   clarinet new nft-dex-marketplace
   cd nft-dex-marketplace
   ```

3. **Add the contract to your Clarinet.toml**:
   ```toml
   [contracts.nft-dex-marketplace]
   path = "contracts/nft-dex-marketplace.clar"
   depends_on = []
   ```

4. **Test the contract**:
   ```bash
   clarinet test
   ```

5. **Check contract syntax**:
   ```bash
   clarinet check
   ```

### Contract Usage

#### Core Functions

1. **List an NFT**:
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .nft-dex-marketplace create-nft-listing 
     nft-contract 
     token-id 
     price-in-ustx 
     enable-fractional 
     total-shares)
   ```

2. **Execute Trade** (for fractional purchases):
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .nft-dex-marketplace execute-trade 
     listing-id 
     shares-to-buy)
   ```

3. **Complete NFT Transfer** (for full NFT purchases):
   ```clarity
   ;; Step 1: Execute trade
   (contract-call? .nft-dex-marketplace execute-trade listing-id u1)
   
   ;; Step 2: Complete NFT transfer
   (contract-call? .nft-dex-marketplace complete-nft-transfer
